# react-vr-demos

# What's that?
Those are the demos which I show during my Introduction to ReactVR talk.

# How do I run it?
1. `npm install -g yarn` (You can use `npm` if you want, that's fine)
2. Run `yarn` (or `npm install`)
3. `npm start`
4. Go to `http:/localhost:8081/vr/` in your favorite browser

# Where can I see it in action?
I gave a talk which showcased this example, see it here (in Polish): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCHq-8rQz1Q&
